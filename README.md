A Deep Learning Approach to Solving PDEs: Implementing DeepONets with Jax and NumPy

## Project Overview

This project is part of my undergraduate bachelor's thesis in which I explored and implemented neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). The primary focus was on the DeepONet architecture, which is a deep learning-based approach for learning mathematical operators. Our focus on DeepONets learning antiderivative and implicit-differential operators.
